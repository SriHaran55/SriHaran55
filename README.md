## Sri here👋 

Hey there! I'm a tech aficionado from Amrita University, Coimbatore. I love to explore new technologies and create cool projects that solve real-world problems. My journey in the world of coding began 4 years ago, and I've been hooked ever since! When I'm not coding, you can find me capturing moments through my lens as a photographer, or refining my editing skills to bring those moments to life.
